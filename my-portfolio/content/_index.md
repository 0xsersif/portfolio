# I Build Production ML Systems and I Ship

ML Engineer from Morocco with a background in networks and telecommunications, now specializing in **MLOps, LLM engineering, and production-grade AI systems**.

## What I Do

🚀 **Production ML Engineering** — End-to-end ML pipelines, not just notebooks  
🤖 **LLM Systems** — RAG, fine-tuning, multi-agent workflows  
🔧 **MLOps Stack** — Docker, MLflow, W&B, DVC, FastAPI, CI/CD  
⚡ **Full-Stack Foundation** — Python, Go, Flask, cPanel deployments

## Current Focus

- Building RAG systems with LangChain and vector databases
- Fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA/QLoRA on specialized domains
- Deploying live ML demos on Hugging Face Spaces and Streamlit Cloud
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for ML model deployment

## Philosophy

**Production-First**: Move beyond notebooks. Ship structured, containerized repos.  
**Quantified Impact**: "Reduced latency by 40%", "Improved F1-score by 15%"  
**Real-World Data**: No clean Kaggle datasets. Show messy data cleaning skills.  
**Ship, Then Iterate**: Perfect is the enemy of done.
