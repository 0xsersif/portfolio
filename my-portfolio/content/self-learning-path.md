# I Build Real Systems. They Get Used.

Full-stack developer and ML engineer from Morocco focused on production-grade engineering — not demos, not tutorials, not theory.

I design, build, deploy, and run real systems used by real users.

**Recent Proof**
→ Built and launched a race registration platform that processed **800 real registrations** for a live event ([run1events.com](https://run1events.com)) — full stack, database, deployment, and production handling.

## What I Actually Do

**Ship production applications** — not mockups  
**Deploy real infrastructure** — not localhost projects  
**Solve real problems** — not portfolio toys  

Stack:
- Python, Go, C
- Flask / FastAPI backends
- MySQL / PostgreSQL databases
- Docker + Linux servers
- cPanel + self-hosted infra
- ML systems + RAG pipelines

## Engineering Principles

- Production > prototypes
- Metrics > claims
- Systems > scripts
- Shipping > talking

**5+ years self-learning by building real systems**  
Not trained to pass exams — trained to make software work in the real world.

### Our Philosophy: Scents That Echo Resilience

At **Eclipsis**, every bottle is more than a fragrance—it's a whisper of transformation, a reminder that true essence emerges from shadows. Our scents are crafted for those who embrace the eclipse: moments of darkness that reveal hidden light. But our story isn't just about perfume; it's about the journey behind it. Let me share mine, raw and real, because Eclipsis was born from my own path of self-learning, stumbles, and unbreakable grit.

#### From Dropout to Dawn: My Code Odyssey

I was 19, staring at college walls that felt like cages. Lectures droned on, but my mind wandered to lines of code I'd sneak in on my laptop. One day, I walked out—dropped out cold. No plan, just a fire to build something real. Friends called it reckless; family worried. But I knew: the world's best builders don't wait for degrees. They code through the chaos.

Started with basics: free YouTube tutorials on Python, scratching out "Hello, World" at 2 AM. Felt like magic—words turning into action. But vibes alone don't pay bills. I dove into bootcamps: first, Zone 01's 1-month Shell and Golang piscine. Intense, no sleep, debugging till dawn. Failed to advance. Gut punch. Next, 42 Network's Shell and C piscine—another month of raw grind. Pushed limits, but rejection hit hard. "Not selected." Words that echoed failure.

Those failures? They crushed me. Days of doubt: "Am I even cut out for this?" Slept on the floor, questioning everything. But failure isn't final—it's fuel. I pivoted to Python, the language that felt like home. No rigid rules, just flow. Started with Flask: simple web apps, local servers spinning up in minutes. My first "petty deacon weep app" (typo or not, it was mine)—a basic todo list that actually worked. High on that win, I built more: URL shorteners, timers. Local only, but alive.

Love hit: programming wasn't a job; it was obsession. Failures taught me: C sharpened logic, Shell built resilience, Go showed speed. Python? It let me create. No more "lost"—I was forging.

#### The Eclipse: Building Eclipsis for Family

My brother dreamed of a perfume startup: scents that capture souls, not shelves. "Help with the web app?" he asked. Me? The dropout who failed twice? Hell yes. Turned my Flask vibes into reality: product catalogs, smart carts, checkouts with shipping math. Added dark mode luxury, glassmorphism glow—2025 sleek. Bugs? Crushed 'em. Doubts? Code through.

Eclipsis isn't perfect—neither am I. But it's proof: self-learning wins when schools fail. From Morocco's streets to global screens, we ship scents that eclipse ordinary. Our philosophy? Embrace the fail, craft your essence. Every bottle holds that story—yours, mine, resilient.
