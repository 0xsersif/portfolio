# About 0xsersif

## Technical Background

I'm a full-stack developer with **5 years of self-directed learning** in Python, Go, and C. I build and ship web applications, websites, and now AI/ML systems. My experience spans frontend, backend, infrastructure, and production deployment.

## Core Technical Stack

**Languages** (5+ years self-learning)
- **Python** — Backend, ML systems, automation, data processing
- **Go** — Performant CLI tools and backend services
- **C** — Systems-level programming and optimization
- **HTML & CSS** — Certified in web design and responsive layouts
- **JavaScript** — Frontend development and interactivity

**Web Development**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, responsive design, modern UI/UX
- **Backend**: Flask, FastAPI, Node.js
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL optimization
- **Full-Stack**: Built and shipped multiple web applications and websites

**Infrastructure & Deployment**
- **cPanel**: Production deployment, hosting management, domain setup
- **PHP & MySQL**: Server-side scripting, database administration
- **Raspberry Pi Self-Hosting**: Running web servers and applications on personal hardware
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments
- **Linux**: Server management, system administration

**ML/AI Stack**
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain
- **MLOps**: Docker, MLflow, Weights & Biases, DVC
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces

## Development Practices

Building Production Systems — End-to-end applications, not just prototypes  
Shipping Real Code — Deployed websites, apps, and ML systems to production  
Infrastructure Knowledge — cPanel hosting, Raspberry Pi self-hosting, Docker  
Learning by Building — Every project solves a real problem  
Clean Code — Professional structure, documentation, version control  
Quantified Results — Measurable improvements in performance and user experience

## Experience Highlights

**Web Applications & Websites**: Built multiple full-stack applications deployed to production with cPanel  
**Database Design**: MySQL database architecture and optimization for web applications  
**Server Management**: Configured and maintained web servers on cPanel and Raspberry Pi  
**Infrastructure**: Self-hosted applications on Raspberry Pi, learned systems-level operations  
**Frontend to Backend**: Complete understanding of web stack from HTML/CSS to server-side code  
**ML Engineering**: Extended skills into ML/AI systems while maintaining full-stack foundation

## Professional Background

### Networks & Telecommunications → Full-Stack Development → ML Engineering

Leveraged technical foundation in networks to build robust, well-architected applications. Understanding of protocols, connection optimization, and system design informs ML engineering decisions.

**Evolution**:
1. **Networks/Telecom** — System design, protocols, optimization
2. **Full-Stack Dev** — Python, Go, Flask, production deployments
3. **ML Engineering** — MLOps, LLMs, production AI systems

This progression gives me a unique perspective on **performance optimization**, **data pipelines**, and **production-ready deployments**.

## 2026 Tech Stack Goals

Building toward modern ML engineering standards:

- **MLOps**: Full CI/CD for model training, testing, and deployment
- **LLM Systems**: Advanced RAG with multi-modal inputs, agent orchestration
- **Edge AI**: Optimize models for Raspberry Pi, mobile, embedded devices
- **Monitoring**: Real-time model performance tracking, drift detection
- **Frontend**: Minimalist design with glassmorphism, dark mode, accessibility
- **Performance**: <1s inference times, optimized assets, mobile-first
- **Technical Communication**: Write architectural deep-dives and decision logs
