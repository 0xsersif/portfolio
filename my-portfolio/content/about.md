# About 0xMuler

## Core ML Stack

**Languages**
- **Python** — Primary language, certified through CS50P (Harvard)
- **Go** — For minimal, performant backend tools and CLIs

**ML/AI Frameworks**
- PyTorch — Deep learning and model training
- Hugging Face Transformers — LLM development and fine-tuning
- LangChain / LlamaIndex — RAG systems and LLM orchestration
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost — Classical ML and boosting

**MLOps & Production Tools**
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases (W&B)
- **Data Versioning**: DVC (Data Version Control)
- **Vector Databases**: ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS
- **API Development**: FastAPI, Flask
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for linting, testing, model deployment
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP (deployment and inference)

**Traditional Full-Stack**
- Flask — Web application development
- Git/GitHub — Professional version control
- cPanel — Production deployment experience
- SQL — Data manipulation and querying

## Development Practices

✅ **End-to-End MLOps** — Production pipelines, not just .ipynb notebooks  
✅ **Live Demos** — Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, AWS  
✅ **Structured Repos** — Professional READMEs, architecture diagrams, setup instructions  
✅ **Quantified Metrics** — "Reduced latency by 40%", "Improved F1 by 15%"  
✅ **Real-World Data** — Web scraping, API calls, messy data cleaning  
✅ **CI/CD Automation** — GitHub Actions for lint, test, deploy  
✅ **Modern UI/UX** — Dark mode, glassmorphism, responsive design  
✅ **Technical Writing** — Blogs explaining architectural decisions

## Education & Learning Path

### Formal Training

**CS50P (Harvard)** — Introduction to Programming with Python (Certified)  
Completed Harvard's rigorous Python course covering fundamentals to advanced concepts.

**1337 School** — Python-focused projects and collaborative learning  
Peer-learning environment emphasizing practical problem-solving.

**Networks/Telecommunications** — Professional background  
Technical foundation in protocols, connection optimization, and system design.

### Self-Paced Learning

> I believe in **learning by building**. My projects come from real needs, not tutorials.

- Built RAG systems to answer questions from private document sets
- Fine-tuned LLMs on specialized domains using LoRA/QLoRA
- Deployed multi-agent AI workflows for automated research
- Created evaluation dashboards to measure and minimize hallucinations
- Implemented real-time recommendation systems with Kafka/Spark
- Optimized YOLO models for edge deployment on Raspberry Pi

I use tools like **Obsidian** for task management and **Git** for tracking every iteration of my work.

## Professional Background

### Networks & Telecommunications → Full-Stack Development → ML Engineering

Leveraged technical foundation in networks to build robust, well-architected applications. Understanding of protocols, connection optimization, and system design informs ML engineering decisions.

**Evolution**:
1. **Networks/Telecom** — System design, protocols, optimization
2. **Full-Stack Dev** — Python, Go, Flask, production deployments
3. **ML Engineering** — MLOps, LLMs, production AI systems

This progression gives me a unique perspective on **performance optimization**, **data pipelines**, and **production-ready deployments**.
